const quiz = [
    {question: "The Multivac machine stops unexpectedly in the middle of a cycle. What is the most likely cause?", options: ["Vacuum leak", "Safety sensor triggered", "Incorrect temperature settings", "Film misaligned"], answer: 1, explanation: "Safety sensors can halt the cycle immediately if they detect a safety risk, even without showing an explicit error message."},
    {question: "Packages show partial sealing on one side. Which adjustment is required?", options: ["Increase sealing temperature", "Decrease vacuum time", "Change the film type", "Adjust conveyor speed"], answer: 0, explanation: "Insufficient sealing temperature often causes weak or incomplete seals on packaging."},
    {question: "The film tears during feeding. What is the most probable reason?", options: ["Excessive sealing pressure", "Film tension too high or misaligned", "Vacuum pump failure", "Heater malfunction"], answer: 1, explanation: "High tension or misalignment creates stress on the film, leading to tears."},
    {question: "The vacuum chamber doesn't reach the programmed value. What should you check first?", options: ["Heating element", "Vacuum pump oil level or leak", "Temperature sensor", "Film thickness"], answer: 1, explanation: "A low oil level or leaks in the vacuum system reduce pumping efficiency."},
    {question: "Sealing is uneven along the package edge. Which component is most likely causing this?", options: ["Sealing plate worn or dirty", "Incorrect vacuum time", "Faulty conveyor sensor", "Air supply pressure too high"], answer: 0, explanation: "Dirty or worn sealing plates prevent uniform contact during sealing, resulting in uneven edges."},
    {question: "The machine triggers frequent temperature errors. What is the likely cause?", options: ["Vacuum leak", "Defective heating element or thermocouple", "Incorrect program settings", "Film not properly positioned"], answer: 1, explanation: "Defective heating elements or thermocouples lead to inaccurate temperature readings and error messages."},
    {question: "After changing the mold, packages are incorrectly formed. What is required?", options: ["Clean the chamber", "Update machine parameters for the new mold", "Replace the vacuum pump", "Use a different film"], answer: 1, explanation: "Each mold requires specific vacuum, sealing, and cycle time parameters to operate correctly."},
    {question: "Film is not advancing at the correct time. Which is the likely cause?", options: ["Film drive motor failure", "Worn gear system", "Advancement sensor faulty", "Conveyor misaligned"], answer: 2, explanation: "A faulty advancement sensor is often the primary cause of incorrect film timing."},
    {question: "The AMS system fails to change filaments automatically. What could be the problem?", options: ["Filament jam", "AMS motor fault", "Color sensor dirty", "Incorrect filament length"], answer: 0, explanation: "Filament jams are the most common cause preventing the AMS system from switching filaments."},
    {question: "Vacuum noise is abnormal during operation. Which is a probable cause?", options: ["Vacuum pump low oil", "Clogged filter", "Bearing wear", "Loose vacuum hose"], answer: 3, explanation: "Leaks in vacuum hoses are a common source of abnormal vacuum noise."},
    {question: "Operator cannot start manual cycle. What should be checked first?", options: ["START button function", "Safety sensor status", "Program parameters", "Emergency stop pressed"], answer: 1, explanation: "Safety sensors actively prevent manual cycle start if any protective element is open or unsafe."},
    {question: "The conveyor stops suddenly without alarm. Likely reason?", options: ["Overload on motor", "Sensor obstruction", "Electrical fault", "Incorrect film alignment"], answer: 1, explanation: "A blocked or misaligned sensor can stop the conveyor silently to prevent errors or damage."},
    {question: "Temperature of the product is not reached. What could be wrong?", options: ["Heating element failure", "Defective temperature sensor", "Incorrect cycle settings", "Conveyor misalignment"], answer: 3, explanation: "Mechanical misalignment can prevent proper contact with the heater, affecting product temperature."},
    {question: "Machine shows error on PLC communication. What is the likely cause?", options: ["Disconnected cable", "Defective PLC", "Software mismatch", "Incorrect network configuration"], answer: 0, explanation: "Check cabling first as it is the most common cause of PLC communication errors."},
    {question: "Air remains in the package after sealing. Likely reason?", options: ["Vacuum time too short", "Package material wrong", "Sealing temperature too high", "Conveyor speed too fast"], answer: 0, explanation: "Insufficient vacuum time prevents air from being fully removed before sealing."},
    {question: "Packages stick to the sealing plate. What should you adjust?", options: ["Sealing plate temperature", "Release agent application", "Film tension", "Conveyor speed"], answer: 1, explanation: "Applying a proper release agent prevents packages from sticking to the sealing plate."},
    {question: "Operator receives a generic error message. What should be checked?", options: ["Program parameters", "Sensor operation", "Electrical system", "Software version"], answer: 3, explanation: "Outdated or incorrect software can trigger generic error messages."},
    {question: "Film alignment after roll change is off. What adjustment is needed?", options: ["Tension control", "Roll holder adjustment", "Film guide sensors", "Machine frame alignment"], answer: 2, explanation: "Film guide sensors usually need adjustment to correct alignment after a roll change."},
    {question: "Sealing lateral edges are weak. What adjustment is recommended?", options: ["Increase sealing temperature", "Increase sealing pressure", "Increase sealing time", "Adjust film type"], answer: 1, explanation: "Increasing sealing pressure can improve lateral edge sealing quality."},
    {question: "The product sensor does not detect items properly. Likely cause?", options: ["Dirty sensor", "Misaligned product", "Faulty sensor", "Ambient light interference"], answer: 0, explanation: "A dirty sensor is the most common reason for detection failures."},
    {question: "Machine shuts down intermittently. Most probable reason?", options: ["Electrical instability", "PLC firmware issue", "Overheating motor", "Loose wiring"], answer: 0, explanation: "Power supply instability is a common cause of unexpected shutdowns."},
    {question: "Vacuum chamber does not seal properly. Which factor is critical?", options: ["Vacuum gasket integrity", "Vacuum pump capacity", "Film type", "Sealing plate condition"], answer: 0, explanation: "Damaged or worn gaskets prevent proper vacuum sealing."},
    {question: "Machine fails to feed product automatically. First check?", options: ["Feeder motor", "Sensor at entry", "Mechanical obstruction", "Software configuration"], answer: 1, explanation: "Sensor detection issues often prevent the feeding system from operating."},
    {question: "Heater alarm triggers during operation. Most likely reason?", options: ["Heater element failure", "Thermocouple malfunction", "Incorrect program settings", "Power fluctuation"], answer: 2, explanation: "Incorrect program settings can trigger heater alarms despite functional hardware."},
    {question: "Operator cannot advance to next cycle. What is usually the cause?", options: ["Safety interlock active", "Incorrect program selection", "Mechanical jam", "Film misalignment"], answer: 0, explanation: "Active safety interlocks prevent cycle advancement until resolved."},
    {question: "Packages are not centered on the conveyor. Likely reason?", options: ["Film misalignment", "Incorrect conveyor setup", "Sensor calibration", "Operator error"], answer: 1, explanation: "Incorrect conveyor alignment often causes packages to be off-center."},
    {question: "Vacuum level fluctuates during operation. Primary check?", options: ["Pump oil level", "Leak in hoses", "Clogged filter", "Pump wear"], answer: 1, explanation: "Leaks in the vacuum system often cause unstable vacuum levels."},
    {question: "Sealing time is too short. What parameter should be adjusted?", options: ["Increase sealing time", "Increase temperature", "Increase pressure", "Change film"], answer: 0, explanation: "Increasing the sealing time ensures proper fusion of the packaging material."}
